Both the Orson Welles radio broadcast of 'War of the Worlds' in 1938 and the Yellow Journalism surrounding the sinking of the USS Maine in 1898 are prime examples of how misinformation and sensationalism can incite panic and fear among the public.

The 'War of the Worlds' broadcast by Orson Welles was a radio adaptation of H.G. Wells' novel that detailed an alien invasion of Earth. The broadcast was presented in a realistic news bulletin format, causing widespread confusion and panic among listeners who believed that it was a real event. This incident highlighted the power of radio as a medium for disseminating information and the potential for misinformation to spread rapidly and incite fear.

Similarly, the Yellow Journalism surrounding the sinking of the USS Maine in 1898 played a significant role in stoking public sentiment and fueling the Spanish-American War. The sensationalized reporting by newspapers like William Randolph Hearst's New York Journal and Joseph Pulitzer's New York World exaggerated the circumstances of the Maine's explosion and blamed Spain for the incident, ultimately shaping public opinion in favor of war.

Dr. Carter's research underscores the importance of critically analyzing media content and understanding how misinformation can be used to manipulate public sentiment. By examining historical cases like the 'War of the Worlds' broadcast and the Yellow Journalism surrounding the USS Maine, we can gain insights into the mechanisms by which misleading information can influence public perception and lead to widespread fear and panic.
