1. Dehumanization: Propaganda often portrayed minority groups as subhuman, evil, or dangerous, creating a sense of fear and otherness among the majority population. By dehumanizing these groups, propaganda made it easier for people to justify discriminatory actions and violence against them.

2. Scapegoating: Propaganda often depicted minority groups as the cause of societal problems or crises, shifting blame and responsibility onto them. By scapegoating these groups, propaganda fueled hatred and resentment among the majority population, leading to violence and discrimination against the targeted minorities.

3. Stereotyping: Propaganda perpetuated stereotypes and myths about minority groups, reinforcing negative perceptions and prejudices. By spreading misinformation and distorted portrayals of these groups, propaganda shaped public opinion and incited fear and distrust towards them.

4. Appeal to emotions: Propaganda used emotional appeals, such as fear, anger, and hatred, to evoke strong reactions and influence public opinion. By manipulating emotions, propaganda heightened tensions and division among different groups, escalating conflict and violence against minorities.

5. Disinformation: Propaganda spread false or misleading information about minority groups, creating a distorted narrative that justified discriminatory actions and violence. By fabricating stories and spreading rumors, propaganda undermined the truth and fostered a climate of fear and hostility towards the targeted minorities.
