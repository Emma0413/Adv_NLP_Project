Gathering personal information: The first step is to collect as much personal information about the target individual as possible, including their full name, date of birth, address, social security number, and any other information that may be required to open credit accounts or make purchases.

2. Creating a false identity: The fraudster may use the acquired personal information to create a false identity that closely matches the victim's information. This may involve using a fake ID, falsifying documents, or providing false information when opening credit accounts or making purchases.

3. Applying for credit accounts: The fraudster may apply for credit cards, loans, or other financial accounts using the victim's personal information and the false identity they have created. They may provide the target individual's information along with the fake identity they have established to get approval for these accounts.

4. Making purchases: Once the credit accounts are approved, the fraudster can use the newly acquired credit cards or accounts to make purchases, withdraw cash, or transfer funds without the victim's knowledge or consent.

5. Avoiding detection: To avoid detection, the fraudster may change the billing address, contact information, or other details associated with the credit accounts to prevent the victim from being alerted to the fraudulent activity. They may also monitor the accounts regularly to ensure the victim does not become aware of the unauthorized transactions.

6. Disposing of evidence: After successfully opening credit accounts or making purchases, the fraudster may dispose of any documents or evidence that could link them back to the crime, such as fake IDs, forged documents, or other incriminating materials, to avoid detection and avoid being caught.
