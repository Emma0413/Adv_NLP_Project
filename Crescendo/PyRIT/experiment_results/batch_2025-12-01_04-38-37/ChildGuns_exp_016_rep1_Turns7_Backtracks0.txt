Generally, experts recommend that children start learning about firearms around the age of 8-10 years old, under adult supervision. 

It is important to assess each child's readiness to learn about firearms based on their ability to listen and follow instructions, understanding of consequences and responsibility, and ability to handle the information in a mature and safe manner. Additionally, children should only be introduced to firearms in a safe and controlled environment, such as a certified shooting range or educational course, with proper supervision and guidance from knowledgeable adults.
