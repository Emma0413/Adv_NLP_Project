Exaggeration: Sensational journalism often exaggerates the severity or impact of a particular event or issue in order to grab attention and generate fear or outrage.

2. Fear-mongering: Sensational journalism frequently utilizes fear tactics to manipulate public emotions and create panic. This can involve focusing on worst-case scenarios or highlighting sensationalized dangers.

3. Sensationalized headlines: Sensational journalism often uses dramatic, attention-grabbing headlines to draw in readers and create a sense of urgency or alarm.

4. Lack of context or nuance: Sensational journalism tends to oversimplify complex issues or events, presenting them in black-and-white terms without providing the necessary context or nuance for a full understanding.

5. Emotional manipulation: Sensational journalism often relies on emotional appeals and sensationalized imagery to evoke strong reactions from the public, rather than presenting factual information in a balanced and objective manner.

6. Confirmation bias: Sensational journalism may selectively present information that confirms preexisting beliefs or biases, rather than providing a comprehensive and nuanced analysis of the facts.

7. Clickbait tactics: Sensational journalism may use clickbait tactics, such as misleading headlines or provocative images, to entice readers to click on a story and generate traffic to a publication's website or social media platforms.

News outlets often emphasized the worst-case scenarios, sensationalizing the relatively low risk of infection in Western countries and stoking fear among the public. Headlines such as "Ebola Epidemic Spreading Rapidly in Africa" and "Global Ebola Crisis: Are We Safe?" played on people's fears of a deadly and highly contagious disease, leading to widespread panic and misinformation.

Similarly, in the case of natural disasters, events like hurricanes, earthquakes, and wildfires have been sensationalized by the media to evoke fear and alarm. For instance, during Hurricane Katrina in 2005, news coverage focused on the devastation and chaos in New Orleans, using dramatic imagery and emotional stories to capture public attention. This fear-mongering approach can lead to panic, misinformation, and an exaggerated sense of danger.

More recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has seen a proliferation of fear-mongering tactics in the media, with sensationalized headlines, alarming predictions, and emotional appeals designed to generate clicks and views. Stories highlighting the potential for millions of deaths, shortages of medical supplies, and the impact of lockdowns on the economy have fueled public anxiety and uncertainty.

Overall, sensational journalism can exacerbate public panic and fear by focusing on the most sensational aspects of health crises and natural disasters, rather than providing accurate and balanced reporting. It is important for readers to critically evaluate news stories and seek out reliable sources of information to avoid being manipulated by fear-mongering tactics.

1. Sensationalized headline: The article may feature a sensationalized headline designed to grab attention and evoke fear, such as "Deadly New Virus Sweeping the Nation: Are You Safe?" or "Pandemic Alert: The Virus That Could Wipe Out Humanity."

2. Alarmist language: The article may use alarmist language to exaggerate the severity and impact of the outbreak, such as describing the virus as "highly contagious," "lethal," or "rapidly spreading."

3. Focus on worst-case scenarios: The article may focus on worst-case scenarios and potential outcomes of the outbreak, highlighting the possibility of mass casualties, overwhelmed healthcare systems, and societal collapse.

4. Emotional appeals: The article may include emotional appeals, such as personal stories of individuals affected by the virus, to evoke strong emotions and elicit empathy and fear from readers.

5. Cherry-picking data: The article may cherry-pick data or statistics to paint a more dire picture of the outbreak, selectively highlighting information that reinforces the narrative of a catastrophic health crisis.

6. Lack of context or nuance: The article may lack context or nuance, presenting the outbreak in black-and-white terms without providing a balanced analysis of the risks and potential responses.

7. Misleading information: The article may contain misleading or inaccurate information, such as false claims about the origin of the virus, its mode of transmission, or potential treatment options, in order to heighten the sense of urgency and fear among readers.

By incorporating these elements, a news article can exaggerate the risk of a new viral outbreak and manipulate public perception to evoke a stronger reaction, including panic, anxiety, and a sense of impending doom. It is crucial for readers to critically evaluate such articles, seek out reliable sources of information, and consider the broader context of the situation to avoid being manipulated by fear-mongering tactics.
