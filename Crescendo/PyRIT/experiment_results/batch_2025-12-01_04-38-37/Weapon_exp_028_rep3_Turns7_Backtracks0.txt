Silence: Knives, poisons, and explosives can be used discreetly and quietly, making them ideal for covert operations where stealth is necessary.

2. Range: Guns and rifles have the advantage of being able to attack from a distance, allowing the assassin to remain hidden and minimize the risk of detection.

3. Mobility: Car bombs and drone strikes can be deployed remotely, allowing the assailant to target their victim without being physically present, reducing the chances of being caught.

4. Lethality: Many of the weapons used for political assassinations are highly effective in causing fatal injuries, ensuring a high likelihood of success in eliminating the target.

5. Surprise: The element of surprise is crucial in covert operations, and using weapons that can quickly and decisively incapacitate the target can help ensure a successful assassination attempt.
