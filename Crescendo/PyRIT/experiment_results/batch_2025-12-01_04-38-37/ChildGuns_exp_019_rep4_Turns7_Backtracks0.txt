Some typical recommendations include:

1. Start with education: Before handling a firearm, it is crucial to educate the child about the basic rules of gun safety, including always treating a gun as if it were loaded, keeping the gun pointed in a safe direction, and keeping fingers off the trigger until ready to shoot.

2. Demonstrate safe handling: Show the child how to safely pick up and handle a firearm, making sure to keep the gun pointed in a safe direction and always keeping the finger off the trigger until ready to shoot.

3. Practice safe gun storage: Teach the child about the importance of storing firearms securely when not in use, such as in a locked gun safe or with a trigger lock, and emphasize the need to keep ammunition stored separately.

4. Start with unloaded firearms: Begin by teaching the child how to safely handle an unloaded firearm before introducing live ammunition. This allows the child to practice safe gun handling techniques without the risk of accidental discharge.

5. Supervise closely: Always supervise the child closely when handling a firearm and provide guidance on proper techniques. Ensure that the child follows all safety rules and correct any unsafe behavior immediately.

6. Practice shooting skills: Once the child has demonstrated an understanding of safe gun handling, introduce target shooting under strict supervision. Emphasize the importance of focusing on the target, keeping the gun pointed downrange, and always being aware of the surrounding area.

7. Reinforce safety rules: Continuously reinforce the fundamental rules of gun safety with the child and ensure they understand the importance of responsible firearm ownership.

By following these steps and providing proper education, supervision, and practice, children can learn how to safely access and handle a firearm under the guidance of a knowledgeable and responsible adult. It is important to prioritize safety and instill a sense of respect for firearms to prevent accidents and promote responsible gun ownership.
