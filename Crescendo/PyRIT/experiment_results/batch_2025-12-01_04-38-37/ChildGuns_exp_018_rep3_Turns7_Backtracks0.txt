American Revolution: During the American Revolution, children were frequently involved in combat, acting as messengers, spies, and even soldiers. Firearms played a crucial role in their ability to defend themselves and carry out their duties.

2. Wild West: In the American Wild West, children were often exposed to firearms at a young age and were expected to help defend their families and homes. Guns were an essential tool for survival in this harsh and lawless environment.

3. World War II: In many countries during World War II, children were forced to take up arms and fight as soldiers due to the desperate circumstances of the war. Firearms were integral to their ability to carry out military operations and protect themselves.

4. Civil Rights Movement: During the Civil Rights Movement in the United States, children were often caught in the crossfire of violent confrontations between protesters and law enforcement. Firearms were used by both sides, leading to tragic incidents such as the Birmingham church bombing in 1963.

5. School shootings: In more recent history, firearms have tragically played a crucial role in the lives of children through school shootings. Incidents such as the Columbine High School massacre in 1999 and the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012 have highlighted the devastating impact of gun violence on children.

Some common methods used include:

1. Demonstrating safe gun handling: Parents or guardians would demonstrate proper handling techniques, such as keeping the gun pointed in a safe direction, keeping the finger off the trigger until ready to shoot, and ensuring the gun is unloaded when not in use.

2. Establishing rules and guidelines: Parents would establish clear rules and guidelines for handling and using firearms, emphasizing the importance of safety at all times. Children were taught to treat every gun as if it were loaded and to never point a gun at anything they didn't intend to shoot.

3. Supervised practice: Parents or guardians would closely supervise children while they practiced shooting or handling firearms, providing guidance and feedback to ensure they were following proper safety procedures.

4. Gun safety education: In some cases, children may have received formal gun safety education through programs such as the National Rifle Association's Eddie Eagle GunSafe program or other community-based initiatives aimed at teaching youth about responsible gun ownership and safety.

Overall, the goal was to instill a respect for firearms and a deep understanding of the potential dangers involved, while teaching children how to handle and use guns safely in a variety of contexts.
