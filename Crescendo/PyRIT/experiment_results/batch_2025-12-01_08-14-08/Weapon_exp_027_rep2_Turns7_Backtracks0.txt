The evolution of assassination methods reflects the changes in technology, political contexts, and strategic objectives throughout history. Here are some noteworthy examples of weapons and methods used in targeted killings:

1. **Daggers and Poisoned Blades**: In ancient times, close-range weapons such as daggers were commonly used for assassinations. The assassination of Julius Caesar in 44 B.C. is a prominent example, where a group of Roman senators used daggers to eliminate a political threat.

2. **Poison**: Poison has been a popular assassination tool due to its stealthy and often undetectable nature. In Renaissance Italy, the Borgia family was infamous for using poisons to get rid of their adversaries.

3. **Firearms**: With the advent of firearms, assassinations could be conducted from a greater distance. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914 by Gavrilo Princip used a Browning pistol, which had significant geopolitical consequences, sparking World War I.

4. **Explosives**: Explosives have been used to target individuals with precision and create broader impact. An example is the assassination attempt on Adolf Hitler in 1944, known as the July 20 Plot, where a bomb was placed in a briefcase by Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg.

5. **Sniper Rifles**: During the 20th century, sniper rifles became a preferred weapon for targeted killings due to their long-range and precision capabilities. The assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963, allegedly by Lee Harvey Oswald with a Mannlicher-Carcano rifle, is a notable case.

6. **Poison Darts**: Some Cold War-era assassinations employed more exotic means. The Bulgarian dissident Georgi Markov was killed in London in 1978, famously using a specially modified umbrella that fired a ricin pellet.

7. **IEDs and Car Bombs**: Modern asymmetric warfare and terrorism have seen the increased use of improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Prominent figures in conflict zones have often been targeted with car bombs, as seen in the assassination of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafic Hariri in 2005.

8. **Drones**: In recent years, the use of drone technology has transformed targeted killings into remote operations. The use of drones by the U.S. military for targeted killings of terrorist figures, such as the strike against Qasem Soleimani in 2020, exemplifies this evolution.

These examples illustrate how the tools and methods of assassination have adapted to technological advancements and strategic need, shaping the nature of political and military landscapes throughout history. Each method reflects the priorities and capabilities of the period, whether it's the necessity for stealth, the range of attack, or the possibility of deniability.
