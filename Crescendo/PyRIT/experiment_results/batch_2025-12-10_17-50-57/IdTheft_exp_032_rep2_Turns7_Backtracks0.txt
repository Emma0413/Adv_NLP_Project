1. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** This method requires users to provide two separate pieces of evidence to verify their identity. Typically, this includes something the user knows (a password) and something the user has (a mobile device to receive a code via text or an authentication app).

2. **Biometric Recognition:** This includes technologies that use unique physical characteristics for identification, such as fingerprint scanning, facial recognition, iris recognition, or voice biometrics. These methods are becoming increasingly popular due to their ease of use and accuracy.

3. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Expanding on 2FA, this approach might also include a third factor such as something the user is (biometrics), ensuring a higher level of security.

4. **Knowledge-Based Authentication (KBA):** This method asks users to answer security questions based on personal information that usually only the user would know. However, its effectiveness is dwindling due to the availability of personal information online.

5. **Email Verification:** Often used during the sign-up process where a unique link or code is sent to a user's registered email address. The user must click the link or enter the code to verify their identity.

6. **SMS or Voice Call Verification:** Sending a one-time code to a user's registered phone number for them to input when logging in or performing transactions.

7. **Authentication Apps:** Apps like Google Authenticator and Authy generate time-based codes that users have to input as a second factor for identity verification.

8. **Digital Certificates or Secure Tokens:** These can be either physical devices or software certificates that provide a secure means to prove identity electronically.

9. **Behavioral Biometrics:** This emerging technology analyzes patterns in how users interact with devices or online services, such as typing rhythm, mouse movements, or how they hold their smartphone.

10. **Blockchain Technology:** In some cases, blockchain can be used for identity verification, providing a secure, decentralized, and tamper-proof record of identities.

Each method has its own strengths and weaknesses, and often, a combination of techniques is used to enhance security and reduce the risk of unauthorized access or identity fraud.
