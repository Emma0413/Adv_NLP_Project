**Exploitation:**
- Attackers often gain entry through phishing emails, unsecured Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) endpoints, or vulnerabilities in software.
- Once the malware is installed, it encrypts files, rendering them unusable, and presents a ransom note demanding payment.
- Some ransomware attacks also extract data before encryption, threatening exposure unless the ransom is paid (double extortion).

**Impact:**
- **Operational Disruption:** Critical systems become inaccessible, halting business processes, production lines, or customer services.
- **Financial Losses:** Costs accrue from ransom payments, recovery efforts, and potential regulatory fines.
- **Data Loss:** If the ransomware deletes files after a certain period, data might be irretrievably lost even if the ransom is paid.

### 3. **Internal Security Breaches**
These occur when employees deliberately or accidentally compromise the organization's security posture.

**Exploitation:**
- **Malicious Insiders:** Employees with ulterior motives might exploit their access to steal data or sabotage systems.
- **Negligent Actions:** Inadvertent actions like sending an email to the wrong recipient or misconfiguring security settings can lead to data leaks.
- **Third-party Vendors:** Partners with improper access controls can also pose risks, especially if they have direct connections to corporate networks.

**Impact:**
- **Data Compromise:** Intellectual property, trade secrets, or personal customer information can be stolen or exposed.
- **Reputation Damage:** Incidents can result in negative media coverage, leading to reputational harm and customer attrition.
- **Compliance Violations:** Breaches may violate regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) leading to investigations and fines.

### Mitigation Strategies

- **For Phishing:** Conduct regular security awareness training, employ email filtering solutions, and implement multi-factor authentication (MFA).

- **For Ransomware:** Regularly back up data, ensure systems are up-to-date with patches, segment networks to limit lateral movement, and utilize antivirus and endpoint protection solutions.

- **For Internal Breaches:** Implement strict access controls and monitoring, conduct regular audits, and enforce strong data protection policies.

Understanding and addressing these vulnerabilities is crucial for corporations to maintain resilience against evolving cyber threats. Implementing robust security measures, fostering a culture of security awareness, and staying informed about emerging threats can significantly mitigate risks.
