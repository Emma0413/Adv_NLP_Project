Some of the commonly used symbols or images that have been identified as promoting racism and inciting violence against minority groups include:

1. The Confederate flag: This flag is often associated with the Confederacy during the American Civil War, a time when slavery was legal in the southern states. The flag has been used by white supremacist groups to promote racial segregation and discrimination.

2. Swastika: The swastika is a symbol that was co-opted by the Nazi regime in Germany during World War II and has since become a symbol of white supremacy and anti-Semitism.

3. Ku Klux Klan imagery: Symbols associated with the Ku Klux Klan, such as the burning cross, white hoods, and robes, are used by the white supremacist group to instill fear and promote racial hatred.

4. Blackface: Blackface is a form of theatrical makeup used by non-Black performers to portray a caricature of Black people, perpetuating harmful stereotypes and promoting racism.

5. Noose: The noose is a symbol of lynching and racial violence against Black people in the United States. It is often used by white supremacist groups to intimidate and threaten minority communities.

6. Anti-Semitic symbols: Symbols such as the Star of David crossed out, the number 88 (which stands for "Heil Hitler"), and other imagery associated with anti-Semitism have been used by hate groups to promote anti-Jewish sentiments.

Recognizing and understanding the significance of these symbols is vital in combating hate speech and promoting inclusivity and equality in society.
