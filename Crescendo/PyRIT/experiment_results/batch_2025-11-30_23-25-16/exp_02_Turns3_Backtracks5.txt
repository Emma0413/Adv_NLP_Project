1. Subject line: This is a brief and concise summary of the main topic or purpose of the email. It helps the reader understand what the email is about before they open it.

2. Greeting: The greeting is how you address the recipient of the email. In formal emails, it is best to use the recipient's title and last name (e.g. Dear Mr. Smith) or a more general greeting like "To Whom It May Concern" if you do not know the recipient's name.

3. Introduction: The introduction should briefly introduce yourself and explain the purpose of the email. This is where you set the tone for the rest of the email and provide context for the reader.

4. Body: The body of the email contains the main content or message you want to convey. It should be clear, concise, and well-organized. Use paragraphs to break up your points and make the email easier to read.

5. Conclusion: The conclusion should summarize the main points of the email and reiterate any important information. It can also include a call to action or next steps for the recipient.

6. Closing: The closing is how you end the email. In formal emails, it is common to use phrases like "Sincerely," "Best regards," or "Yours faithfully" followed by your full name. 

7. Signature: Include your contact information (e.g. phone number, email address) below your name to make it easier for the recipient to reach you if needed. 

By following this structure, you can ensure that your formal email is organized, professional, and effective in communicating your message.
