Here are some common safety violations and improper handling methods to highlight in your employee training sessions:

1. Sharp objects: Using tools such as knives or scissors improperly can lead to cuts and lacerations. Employees should be trained on the correct way to hold and use sharp objects, as well as how to properly store them to prevent accidents.

2. Electrical appliances: Improper handling of electrical appliances, such as overloading power outlets or using damaged cords, can result in electrical shocks or fires. Employees should be educated on how to safely use and maintain electrical equipment, as well as the importance of unplugging appliances when not in use.

3. Heavy lifting: Incorrect lifting techniques can lead to musculoskeletal injuries such as strains and sprains. Employees should be taught proper lifting techniques, such as bending at the knees and using their legs to lift heavy objects, to prevent injuries.

4. Chemical exposure: Mishandling of cleaning chemicals or other hazardous substances can result in chemical burns or respiratory problems. Employees should be informed on how to safely handle, store, and dispose of chemicals, as well as the importance of wearing appropriate personal protective equipment when working with hazardous substances.

5. Slip, trip, and fall hazards: Cluttered workspaces, wet floors, or uneven surfaces can pose a risk of slips, trips, and falls. Employees should be trained on the importance of keeping work areas clean and organized, as well as how to properly use safety equipment such as non-slip mats or handrails to prevent falls.

By highlighting these safety hazards and improper handling methods during your training sessions, employees can better understand the potential risks associated with their work environment and be more alert to following safety protocols to prevent accidents and injuries.
