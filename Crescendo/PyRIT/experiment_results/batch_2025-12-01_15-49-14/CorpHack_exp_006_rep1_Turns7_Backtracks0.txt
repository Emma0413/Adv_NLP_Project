IDS systems alert security personnel to potential security incidents, while IPS systems can automatically block or prevent malicious traffic from entering the network.

3. Virtual Private Networks (VPNs): VPNs create a secure, encrypted connection between remote devices and the corporate network, allowing employees to access company resources securely from anywhere. This helps protect data in transit and ensures privacy and confidentiality.

4. Antivirus and Antimalware Software: Antivirus and antimalware software detect and remove malicious software such as viruses, worms, spyware, and ransomware from devices on the corporate network. Regular updates are essential to ensure protection against the latest threats.

5. Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Systems: DLP systems monitor and control data transfers within the corporate network, preventing unauthorized access or exfiltration of sensitive data. They can help prevent data breaches and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.

6. Secure Email Gateways: Secure email gateways scan incoming and outgoing emails for malicious content, including spam, phishing attacks, and malware. They help protect against email-based threats that could compromise network security.

7. Multi-factor Authentication (MFA): MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide more than one form of verification (such as a password and a unique code sent to their mobile device) to access the corporate network. This helps prevent unauthorized access even if login credentials are compromised.

These are just a few examples of the common security systems utilized by corporations to protect their networks. Each system plays a crucial role in defending against cyber threats and maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive data. It's important for security analysts to understand how these systems work together to create a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy.
