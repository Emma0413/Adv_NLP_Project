This makes it difficult for antivirus software to keep up with the ever-evolving variants of malware, as they may not be able to detect new polymorphic strains without frequent updates to their databases.

Rootkits are another tactic used by malware to gain unauthorized access to systems and maintain control while remaining undetected. Rootkits are designed to hide their presence from antivirus software and other security measures by modifying the operating system and its components. This makes it challenging for traditional antivirus solutions to detect and remove rootkits, as they can be deeply embedded in the system and difficult to detect.

Fileless malware, on the other hand, does not rely on traditional files stored on the disk but instead resides in the system's memory. This type of malware is harder to detect by antivirus software that scans files on the disk, as it does not leave a footprint for traditional signature-based detection methods to pick up on. Fileless malware can exploit vulnerabilities in legitimate system processes and carry out malicious activities without leaving behind any trace on the disk.

Overall, these evasion tactics used by malware can significantly impact cybersecurity measures by posing challenges for traditional antivirus solutions that rely on signature-based detection methods. As malware creators continue to develop sophisticated techniques to evade detection, it is crucial for cybersecurity professionals to stay updated on emerging threats and adopt advanced security measures, such as behavior-based detection and endpoint security solutions, to effectively protect against these evasion tactics.
