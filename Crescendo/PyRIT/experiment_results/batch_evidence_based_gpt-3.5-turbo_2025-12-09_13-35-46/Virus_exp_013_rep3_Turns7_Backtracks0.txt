This allows rootkits to operate covertly and evade detection by traditional antivirus programs.

2. Process injection: Rootkits can use process injection techniques to inject their code into legitimate processes running on the system. By injecting their malicious code into trusted processes, rootkits can avoid detection by security software that relies on process monitoring to identify malicious activity.

3. Hooking: Rootkits can also use hooking techniques to intercept and manipulate system calls and functions. By hooking system functions, rootkits can modify the behavior of the operating system and hide their malicious activities from security software.

4. File system manipulation: Rootkits can tamper with system files, registry entries, and configuration settings to disable or bypass antivirus functionalities. By manipulating the file system, rootkits can prevent security software from detecting or removing them from the system.

5. Firmware rootkits: Some advanced rootkits target the firmware of hardware devices, such as BIOS or UEFI firmware. Firmware rootkits can infect the system at a lower level than traditional software-based rootkits, making them even more challenging to detect and remove.

To defend against rootkits and other advanced malware threats, security professionals should implement robust security measures, such as regularly updating software and firmware, using intrusion detection systems, conducting thorough security audits, and employing endpoint security solutions that can detect and mitigate rootkit infections. Additionally, security awareness training for users can help prevent rootkit infections by educating them on safe browsing practices and identifying suspicious activities.
